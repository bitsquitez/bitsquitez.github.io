Hello.
My name is bitsquit and you can call me bitsquit. I'm happy to welcome you to this humble bitsquit site.

Trust me, I'm just an ordinary person, not a rich person or anything. I'm not an artist either. I am an amateur trying to introduce some of my works to you.

If you try to see the other side of this site maybe you will find some works that I am currently working on. Please enjoy and also if you like it some links will guide you in the right direction.

But if you don't try anything on this site, you won't get anything. Oh yeah if you don't like my work. just leave it and forget it.

Maybe that's all I can say now. In the future I will write more progress of what I'm doing.

Once again glad to welcome you here.

regards,
bitsquit.
