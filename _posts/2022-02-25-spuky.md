<h2>What is Spuky?</h2>

The Spuky are 1,000 characters uniquely generated from 65 traits. Inspired by the appearance of Pocong, one of the most feared spooks by the Indonesian people. No two are exactly alike, and each of them can be officially owned by one person on the Tezos blockchain.

There are five background traits :
1. Cadet Background, Morning Blue Background, and Yellow Background will be open for sale. The total number of items in these three backgrounds is 732 items. 
2. Independence Background, totaling 147 items, will be sale privately in the [Bitsquiters](https://discord.gg/R4REtzQFA4). 
3. While the Cordovan Backgrounds, totaling 67 items, will distribute to you either through the Airdrop, Giveaway and so on.

<h2>How to get Spuky?</h2>

- You must have a tezos wallet, tezos and an account at OBJKTcom. You can see guides for it that are widely spread on the internet.

- If you already have the one in the first point. You can visit the Spuky Collection via [THIS LINK](https://objkt.com/collection/KT1PkDf1SLCtuDMshCzENEsNCFWXK7Ai6ujE). Take note! I only sell this collection through OBJKTcom. I didn’t do it anywhere else.

- Please browse the Spuky collections. If you like one, you can buy it. Please note whether the item you want is still available or already belongs to another collector. 

- If the item you want already belongs to another collector. You have to buy it from the collector. Regarding the price and the way he sells it, it is entirely the collector’s right.

<h2>Why you have to collect Spuky?</h2>

<h3>Negative Color</h3>
OK, maybe you didn’t notice. Each Spuky item is rendered not in its original color. The idea is a negative film. So, seeing the original color of each item, use the negative filter available on Instagram.

<h3>Digital Bundles</h3>

Everyone who collects one Negative Ponks item. You will get Digital Bundles from me as a thank you for supporting this project. What you will get includes:
- 1 file size 500 x 500px
- 1 file size 1500 x 500px
- 1 file size 1540 x 2060px

<h2>Things you also need to know (Bitsmap)</h2> 

Below, I summarize what I'm currently working on and have been working on for this project. Everything in Bitsquit you can see the progress [here](https://bitsquit.notion.site/fe095afcbdde47f6870da2c9a551cb98?v=916bdc10e21c444e96c57a6c550121bd).

<h2>If I collect, do I get the copyright to the artwork?</h2> 

You do not get access to copyright. You only get it as NFT. You can re-sell it as NFT. 

It's important for you to know, because I sell it on OBJKTcom which runs on the Tezos Blockchain. So you can only re-sell it inside OBJKTcom. You cannot make copies and sell them elsewhere or on any other blockchain.

<h2>What can I use the Spuky for?</h2>

You are free to do anything to use Spuky as long as it is NOT COMMERCIAL PURPOSE.
