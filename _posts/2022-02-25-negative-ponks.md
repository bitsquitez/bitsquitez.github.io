<h2>What is Negative Ponks?</h2>

The Negative Ponks are 1,000 characters uniquely generated from 65 traits. Inspired by the appearance of Pocong, one of the most feared ghosts by the Indonesian people. No two are exactly alike, and each of them can be officially owned by one person on the Tezos blockchain.

Of these 1,000 items, there are five background traits. Cadet Background, Morning Blue Background, and Yellow Background will be open for sale. The total number of items in these three backgrounds is 732 items. Background Independence, totaling 147 items, will be sale privately in the Bitsquit community. While the Cordovan Backgrounds, totaling 67 items, will distribute to you either through the Airdrop, Giveaway and so on.

<h2>How to get Negative Ponks?</h2>

- You must have a tezos wallet, tezos and an account at OBJKTcom. You can see guides for it that are widely spread on the internet.

- If you already have the one in the first point. You can visit the Negative Ponks Collection via this link. Take note! I only sell this collection through OBJKTcom. I didn’t do it anywhere else.

- Please browse the negative ponks collection. If you like one, you can buy it. Please note whether the item you want is still available or already belongs to another collector. 

- If the item you want already belongs to another collector. You have to buy it from the collector. Regarding the price and the way he sells it, it is entirely the collector’s right.

<h2>Utilities</h2>

<h3>True Ponks</h3>

I’m going to re-render the Ponks using their original colors. True ponks will be available in 200 items. Every item from True Ponks will come with a 3/3 edition. To the loyal ponks holders. You will have access to True Ponks. The holder is free to do whatever he wants with True Ponks, such as keep it, register it, or give it away.

<h3>Create GIF Album</h3>

For loyal negative ponks holders will also get assets for making GIF albums. Minimum album creation comprises 4 Negative Ponks items.

<h3>Holders Get AirDrops</h3>

As I described above. There will be 67 items that will be stored and distributed in airdrops and giveaways. And the holders will get it first.

<h3>Bitschandise</h3>

Will come soon. We will do further discussion in the community. I have written many concepts about Bitschandise in the future.

Then what makes Negative Ponks unique? OK, maybe you didn’t notice. Each ponks item is rendered not in its original color. The idea is a negative film. So, seeing the original color of each item, use the negative filter available on Instagram.
