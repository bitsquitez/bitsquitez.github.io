The Negative Ponks are 1,000 characters uniquely generated from 65 traits. Inspired by the appearance of Pocong, one of the most feared ghosts by the Indonesian people. No two are exactly alike, and each of them can be officially owned by one person on the Tezos blockchain.

Of these 1,000 items, there are five background traits. Cadet Background, Morning Blue Background, and Yellow Background will be open for sale. The total number of items in these three backgrounds is 732 items. Background Independence, totaling 147 items, will be sale privately in the Bitsquit community. While the Cordovan Backgrounds, totaling 67 items, will distribute to you either through the Airdrop, Giveaway and so on.
